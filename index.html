    <h1 class="main-message"><i>Our Message: Ensure that artificial intelligence is held accountable and has no biases. </i></h1>
    <h3 class="about">Artificial intelligence is taking our world by storm. Today's tasks are done more effectively with AI - that be chores, jobs, or decision-making. Many believe that this incredible technology always makes the right choice since it's so advanced. In many cases, AI is biased. What if it makes the wrong mistake - like job recruiting to catching "criminals". It might seem like something small but, can affect the way of life for many vurnerable populations that rely or interact with AI. They might be machines, but they're slowly taking over our way of life. If one doesn't stop their harmful biases, it will hurt racial minorities and non-males. </h3>
    <h3 class="about"> I want everyone to keep in mind the short-term solutions: diversity training or ethics course for computer science majors. Along with the long term: hiring minorities for AI specialists roles or encouraging them.</h3>
