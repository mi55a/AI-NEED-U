<!-- about me, the creator of the website and my background -->
      <div class="text">
        <h1><i>Hello! My name is Mily and I'm the creator of this site.</i></h1>
        <p>I'm a rising senior in high school and 17-years-old. I've have loved computer science since a young age but, got into it in high school. I've participated in programs like Exelon's STEM Leadership Academy and Kode with Klossy. I'm also part of my school's robotics team as a programmer and competed in Python for my business club! This summer, I'm doing GWC SIP, Kode with Klossy, Fermilab's SAGE Camp, and ComEd's EV Rally (please come see my team on Aug 6, 2022 at MSI)!</p>
    <p id="fun">That's my STEM background, kinda boring eh. Another fun thing about me is that I love K-Pop girl groups! Some of my favorites are Twice, Red Velvet, Blackpink, Itzy, and Stayc.</p>
        <!-- more of my stem background since my issue is STEM-related -->
    <p id="media">My <a id="replit" href="https://replit.com/@mi55a">replit</a> account has a lot of my coding projects and documentation! Check it out if you want to see more from me!</p>

    <!-- why I chose this issue and my mission -->
  <h2 class="my-message">My Mission: Since learning about the biases in AI, when it comes to gender and race, in APCSP, I've wanted to learn more about the issue and spread awareness. As a woman in tech, I know of the racism and sexism in the field. When I talked to people about the issue, they didn't even realize it. So many of us overlook the problem in artificial intelligence with how much it hides behind the "I'm super-advanced" and "I could do no wrong" personas. AI being held accountable and inspected makes way for a safer technological future and erases the possibility of digital dystopia. No matter how big the impact of my mission is, I want to spread awareness and my message. Just knowing about the issue prevents misunderstanding. Please join me on this mission - Mily <3
